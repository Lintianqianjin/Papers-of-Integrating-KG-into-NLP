# Representation Learning of Knowledge Graphs with Entity Descriptions  
## Key Idea
In most knowledge graphs there are usually concise descriptions for entities, which cannot be well utilized by existing methods. This paper proposes a novel representation learning method for knowledge graphs taking advantages of entity descriptions. More specifically, this paper explores two encoders, including continuous bag-of-words and deep convolutional neural models to encode semantics of entity descriptions.
