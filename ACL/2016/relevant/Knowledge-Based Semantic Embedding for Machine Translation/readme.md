# Knowledge-Based Semantic Embedding for Machine Translation  

## Key Idea  
The source sentence is firstly mapped into a knowledge based semantic space. And the context vector, i.e., internal meaning, in this method is no longer implicit continuous number vector, but explicit semantic vector.  
### How to embed the source sentence into a knowledge semantic space?  
Firstly, knowledge base is organized in a tree structure, semantic tuples can be seen as several paths in the tree.
